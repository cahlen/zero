# Vision

## The Dream

Imagine a world where anyone can deploy a fleet of intelligent devices for $15 each. Not locked to a corporation's cloud. Not harvesting your data. Not requiring a subscription. **Truly yours.**

Zero is that foundation.

## What We're Building

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- [x] Reproducible SD card flashing
- [x] WiFi captive portal (no internet needed for setup)
- [x] Over-the-air updates via GitHub releases
- [x] Fleet management with unique device IDs
- [x] AI credential management (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, xAI)
- [x] Modular app architecture (wifi-portal, web, display)

### Phase 2: AI Integration 🔜
- [ ] Dynamic AI app deployment
- [ ] Local LLM support (llama.cpp on Zero 2 W)
- [ ] Voice input/output
- [ ] AI-powered automations
- [ ] Plugin system for community AI apps

### Phase 3: Local Social 🔮
- [ ] Bluetooth/WiFi proximity detection
- [ ] Peer-to-peer messaging (no internet)
- [ ] Local social profiles
- [ ] "Bump" to connect — meet people IRL
- [ ] Community mesh networks
- [ ] Location-based experiences (without tracking)

### Phase 4: Ecosystem 🌍
- [ ] App marketplace (community-driven)
- [ ] Fleet dashboard (self-hosted)
- [ ] Device templates for specific use cases
- [ ] Hardware expansion guides (sensors, displays, audio)

## Philosophy

### Open Source Forever
Zero will always be 100% open source under the MIT license. No "open core" tricks. No premium features. No enterprise editions. **Everything is free, forever.**

### Privacy First
Your devices, your data. Zero never phones home. Updates come from *your* GitHub repo (or fork). AI keys stay on *your* devices. There is no Zero cloud.

### Modular by Design
Don't need AI? Remove it. Want to add mesh networking? Add it. Building a fleet of digital picture frames? Use only the display module. **Take what you need, leave what you don't.**

### Community Driven
The best ideas will come from you. We're building the foundation — you'll build the future. PRs welcome. Forks encouraged. Build something amazing.
